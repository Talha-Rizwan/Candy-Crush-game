# Candy-Crush-game
The objective of project is to make a game in which Player swap one gem with an adjacent gem with the help of mouse(Drag & Drop) to form only horizontal or vertical chain of three or more gems of the same color, Bonus points are given to player when chains of more than three identical gems are formed, but also when two chains are formed in one swap. When chains are formed, the gems disappear, and gems fall from the top to fill in gaps. Sometimes chain reactions are triggered, where chains are formed by the falling gems. Cascades are awarded with bonus points.
